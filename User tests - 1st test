User 1: 
File explorer and green plus button was confusing to differentiate
Same with the meaning of branches and timeline
Layout of interface is confusing - would not know where to start or where to enter a command
Chat is a useful feature
Mascot is useful too
Suggestions: Having a feature to save commands, e.g pressing the up button 
Overall: As a beginner, very confusing on how to use

User 2:
Need to align the lines on the interface so it is easier on the eye
Scale the program to make it fit to screen when resized
Suggestions: Make master branch distinct - change it to a vertical branch? 
             Use images to represent each member of the group and place it on the branch to see what we each did
             Research more on different git clients and see what are the best features of each. Assign one client to each member? 
             Suggested programs to use - Omnigraffle, Gitkraken, Jfile chooser
